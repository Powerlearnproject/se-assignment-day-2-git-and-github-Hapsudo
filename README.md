## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Fundamental concepts:
1. Repository - A storage location where all files and their history changes are mantained.
2. Commit - A snapshot of the project at a specified time.
3. Branching - Creating a separate copy of the project to work on an a new feature without affecting the main codebase.
4. Merging - Combining changes from different branches into one.
5. PRS Pull requests - Used during collaboration of workflows to review and merge changes before integrating them into the main project.
6. Conflict resolution - Handling situations where multiple changes affect the same part of a file.

Why Github is popular
   1. Open source community - Supports millions of open source projects and encourages contribution of developers.
   2. Cloud based - Developers can work from anywhere and contribute to the same projects.
   3. Tracking of issues - Helps to manage bugs, feature requests and tasks in a structures manner.
   4. Pull requests & code reviews - Allow peer reviews before merging changes, improving code quality.
   5. CI/CD Integration - Supports automated testing and deployment pipelines.
   6. Security & Backup - Ensures safety with access control, two factor authentication and repository backups.

  How version control Helps Mantain project integrity
  1. Tracks changes - Each change is logged and timestamped with author details.
  2. Prevents data loss - All changes are recorded and previous versions can be restored.
  3. Ensures code consistency - Standardized workflows with reviews help manatain quality and structure.
  4. Facilitates collaboration - Multiple developers can work simultaneously without overwriting each other's code.
  5. Supports experimentation - Developers are able to create branches to test new features without breaking the main project.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Setting up a new repo on GitHub
1. Go to Github.com and sign in or create an account.
2. Navigate to profile picture on top-right corner and select ' Your repositories'
3. Click 'New' which will lead to repository creation page.
4. Configure the repository name.
5. Describe what the project is all about, this is optional and choose visibility option.
6. You can add READMe file to describe setup instruction, or a .gitignore  File to tellGit which file or foldrs to ignore.
7. Click 'create Repository'
Important Decisions
1. Public/ Private Repository - Consider whether the project will be open-source
2. README File - Helps others understand and contribute to the project.
3. .gitignore - prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.
4. License - Important for open source projects that helps to defien user rights.
## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
